# 1 Git 
I am using Git to always push my code and required file.
I recently have pushed my Expense tracker Python code, requirment.txt file and the UML diagrams.
My git times can be seen at the contribution chart in GitHub.

# 2 UML

I decided to draw 3 UML diagrams i.e 
1) [Activity Daigram](https://github.com/KrishnaNarwade/Expense-Manger-Advanced-Software-Engineering-Project/blob/main/UML%20Diagrams./UML%20Activity%20Diagram1.png):
This activity diagram shows progression and action of the Expense tracker tool.

2) [Use Case Diagram](https://github.com/KrishnaNarwade/Expense-Manger-Advanced-Software-Engineering-Project/blob/main/UML%20Diagrams./Use_Case_Daigram1.png):
This Use-case diagrams describe the high-level functions and scope of a Expense tracker tool.
It also shows interaction between User and System.

3) Component diagram (Still in progress.)
This Component diagram will show the components the expense tracker tool and how they are wired together.

# 3) DDD
Attaching the Darft version of the [DDD](https://github.com/KrishnaNarwade/Expense-Manger-Advanced-Software-Engineering-Project/blob/main/UML%20Diagrams./DDD%20Expense%20Tracker.jpg) diagram.

# 5) Clean Code Development
Yet to be done.
# 6) Build Management

# 7) Tests 
Yet to be done.
# 8) Continuous Delivery
Yet to be done.
# 9) IDE
I choosed Visual studio as an IDE for this Project
VS Code helps you be instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets, and more

My Faviourite Shortcut tools are 
1) ctrl + L : It allows me to clear the output console
# 10) Domain Specific Language  

My DSL is realted to my Expense Tracker project.
Here I have a written small Domain Specific language which just take all the expenses details from the [grocery_expenses](https://github.com/KrishnaNarwade/Financial-Expense-Manager-/blob/main/grocery_expenses.dsl) and Do sum of all yours expenses which you have added in the file. It also shows you what item were purhcased and highest purchase amount of individual product.
For it's Interpreation I have used python language you can find the code here [grocery_expenses_interpreter](https://github.com/KrishnaNarwade/Financial-Expense-Manager-/blob/main/grocery_expenses_interpreter.py)
